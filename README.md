## Why was it made?
Sometimes the number of options available can be a bit overwhelming (especially on an empty stomach). With WSIE, restaurants are presented one at a time and can be discarded or chosen based on gut reaction. There is customization and filtering available if needed, by type of food or price, but the focus is on presenting the user with a series of simple choices that leads them to a stress free meal.

## What was it built with?
- React.js- frontend
- Python/Django- backend
- Yelp API- restaurant data
- ArcGIS REST API- location suggestions/autocomplete
- Google Maps API- embedded maps
